<span class='toggle'>&#x25BC; 1.0.1</span>
<span class='collapsable'>
<ul>
  <li> New changelog page.
  <li> Added compatibility to "dead keys" in international keyboard layouts, such as ~ in Spanish. <br>
  Press the configured keybind (with modifiers, like alt) and then space (with no modifiers) to execute the shortcut. Otherwise, the key works as normally.
</ul>

<span class='toggle'>&#x25BC; 1.0</span>
<span class='collapsable'>
<ul>
  <li> Unfortunately, this update required a configuration reset if coming from previous versions.
  <li> Updated extension's internal functionality to work with Overleaf's new editor package, CodeMirror.
  <li> Updated options page: new layout, reordering controls, automatically saves changes and reconfigures editors.
  <li> Added button to options page from Overleaf editor.
  <li> Fixed console errors when using PDF in separate tab.
  <li> Reworked commands to have customizable selection insertion point and end selection bounds.
  <li> Removed left-right type shortcuts, since the feature is redundant with the reworked commands.
  <li> Shortcuts now work with uppercase characters, e.g. alt-P will produce \Pi with either shift-p or P (with Caps Lock).
  <li> Shortcuts work in a more keyboard layout independent manner (e.g. alt-~ works instead of US-layout alt-shift-`).
  <li> Insertion is now fully compatible with multiple selections/cursors.<br>
  Try it! Hold control, make multiple selections with your mouse and insert many \sqrt{}'s at once by pressing alt-2.
  <li> Changed default shortcuts.
</ul>
